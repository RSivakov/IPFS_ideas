# IPFS ideas

*IPFS all the things!*

- **apt-ipfs**  
  - `apt-get` wrapper.
  - Seeding by just grabbing and pinning the cache.
  - First check IPFS then/if slow degrade to http.
- **inotify-ipfs**  
- **ipfs-ify**  
  Browser plugin that just adds every ressource into IPFS.
- **ipfs-cdn**  
  JS lib that does what PeerCDN did using IPFS.
- **ipfs-twitter**  
  - Browser plugin that extends Twitter.
  - Transparently dual publish.
  - Automatic IPFS-twitter subscription to Twitter-subscribed peers by using their website (the IPFS txt record).
  - Then add surplus like anonymous subscription (when subscribed only via IPFS-twitter just add those tweets from there to the twitter site).
- **ipfs-file-buoy**
